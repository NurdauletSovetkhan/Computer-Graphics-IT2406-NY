## 1. Introduction


In computer graphics and scientific visualization today, visualization of smooth organic curves that can dynamically split and merge is a general problem. Merging spheres are most commonly visualized in fluid simulation, computer graphics film and video game visual effects, and molecule modeling. Real-time visualization of merging spheres using scalable and efficient algorithms is the problem solved by this project.
The underlying urge for this project is to investigate the application of **geometry-shader-based Marching Cubes** in order to compute triangle meshes dynamically on the GPU for rendering spheres that merge together perfectly as they approach one another. This enables real-time rendering of **"blobby objects"** (metaballs) with zero CPU calculations.

## 2. Description of the Project

### 2.1 Objective
The main objective of this project is to apply real-time visualization of spheres colliding one another using an implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm on the GPU.
The objective is to create a smooth 3D surface that updates dynamically in real-time as the spheres move and collide, demonstrating the strength of geometry shaders in modern graphics programming.

### 2.2 Problem Statement
Legacy mesh modeling techniques are fixed and must be updated manually whenever objects are deformed, so they are not suitable for interactive or real-time environments.
This paper addresses the problem of dynamically constructing and rendering a mesh for an aggregate of spheres that merge and diverge in real time.
Such visualization is essential to scientific simulation, game development, and educational tools that require smooth representation of "blobby" or fluid-like objects.

### 2.3 Scope
**Included:**
- Isosurface extraction using the Marching Cubes algorithm.
- Real-time mesh generation on the GPU with the use of geometry shaders.
- Smoothing blending and separation of 2–5 spheres.
- Basic lighting and shading for simple visualization.

**Excluded:**
- Intricate physics simulation or collision detection.
- Accommodation of numerous spheres or high-end performance optimizations beyond this project.
- Intricate texturing, materials, or post-processing effects.

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Tools and Technologies Used
The project is written in **C++** with **Modern OpenGL (Core Profile)** being employed for rendering.
Below libraries and frameworks are utilized:
- **GLFW** – to create windows, handle input, and OpenGL context.
- **GLAD** – to load OpenGL function pointers.
- **GLSL** – to write vertex, geometry, and fragment shaders.
- **CMake / Make** – to build the project (optional).
- **Git** – for version control.

These libraries were chosen for their efficiency, cross-platform, and use on real-time 3D graphics.

### 3.2 Development Process
The project was developed with an **iterative approach**, starting with a basic OpenGL setup, then adding more and more:
1. Input management and window initialization.
2. Barebones rendering pipeline with shaders.
3. Calculation of scalar fields and implementation of Marching Cubes.
4. Geometry shader inclusion of mesh generation.
5. Real-time animation and visualization of the sphere.

Version control was handled using **Git**, with easy rollbacks and feature commits incrementally after each major feature.
Since this is a solo project, Scrum-type collaborative practices were not followed but the development process was done feature-by-feature.

---

### 3.3 Algorithms and Techniques
Several mathematical and algorithmic techniques were applied:
- **Marching Cubes Algorithm** – to reconstruct an isosurface from the scalar field generated by a collection of spheres.
- **Linear Interpolation** – to calculate vertex locations on the faces of cubes when the isosurface crosses.
- **Transformation Matrices (Model, View, Projection)** – to appropriately position and render objects in 3D space.
- **Geometry Shader-Based Mesh Generation** – to shift heavy computation to the GPU and enable real-time updates.
- **Phong or Blinn-Phong Shading Model** – to render smooth lighting and shading on the union surface.
